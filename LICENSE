All of our contracts are OpenSource but with No License. 
They usually contain a date in the header to show when they will become GPL-3.0, if this date is not shown, then the contracts remain fully No License (None).

// Example
// SPDX-License-Identifier: No License (None)
// No permissions granted before Sunday, 5 May 2024, then GPL-3.0 after this date.

Our main reason is that we want our contracts to be battle tested before they are copied and used elsewhere.
